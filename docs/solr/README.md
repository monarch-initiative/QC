### Solr Diffs

Comparison of solr views on beta and production.

These reports are generated every data load with
[jenkins](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/jenkins/).

The queries are not exhaustive; solr queries are configured and can be added to the
[qc yaml configuration](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/release-utils/blob/master/conf/monarch-qc.yaml)

Or alternatively, create a ticket requesting a new query
in the [qc repo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/qc)
