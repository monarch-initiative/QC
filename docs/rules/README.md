### Monarch Rules

Monarch rules are a set of constraints on our knowledge graph,
currently represented in cypher but with future plans to 
leverage sparql and shex.

These rules are queried and reports generated after every data load with
[jenkins](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/jenkins/).

Rules and cypher queries are listed in the
[qc yaml configuration](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/release-utils/blob/master/conf/monarch-qc.yaml)

Or alternatively, create a ticket requesting a new rule
in the [qc repo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/qc)
