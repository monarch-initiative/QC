## Monarch QC Vuepress site

### About

Monarch generates a number of QC and documentation artifacts each release including:
1. [Solr pivot tables](https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/solr.html) ({source, taxa} x {association, relation}) as markdown
2. [Namespace, relation, namespace graphs](https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/dipper/) as graphviz and markdown tables
3. [SciGraph category diffs](https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/scigraph.html) as markdown
4. [Monarch rule violations](https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/rules.html) as markdown
5. [Biolink schemas](https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/biolink/schema.html) as graphviz

This vuepress app is built by slurping up these various resources documents
and displaying them in a centralized dashboard, which also includes [plotly
heatmaps](https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/) of solr pivot tables.

The app runs off of github pages and is hosted on https://qc.monarchinitiative.org/
